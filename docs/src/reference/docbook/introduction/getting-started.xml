    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>Learning a new framework is not always straight forward. In this section, we (the Spring Data team) 
    tried to provide, what we think is, an easy to follow guide for starting with the Spring Data Redis module.
    Of course, feel free to create your own learning 'path' as you see fit and, if possible, please report back
    any improvements to the documentation that can help others.</para>

		<title>First Steps</title>
		
		<para>As explained in <xref linkend="why-spring-redis"/>, Spring Data Redis (SDR) provides integration 
		between	Spring framework and the Redis key value store. Thus, it is important to become acquainted with both of these 
		frameworks (storages or environments depending on how you want to name them). Throughout the SDR documentation, 
		each section provides links to resources relevant however, it is best to become familiar with these topics beforehand.</para>

			<title>Knowing Spring</title>
			<para>Spring Data uses heavily Spring framework's <ulink url="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/spring-core.html">core</ulink> functionality, 
			such as the <ulink url="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html">IoC</ulink> container,
			<ulink url="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html">resource</ulink> abstract or
			<ulink url="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html">AOP</ulink> infrastructure. While it is not important
			to know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is. At a minimum, the idea behind IoC should be familiar.
			That being said, the more knowledge one has about the Spring, the faster she will pick up Spring Data Redis.
			Besides the very comprehensive (and sometimes disarming) documentation that explains in detail the Spring Framework,
			there are a lot of articles, blog entries and books on the matter - take a look at the Spring Guides
			<ulink url="http://spring.io/guides">home page</ulink> for more information. In general, this should be the starting point for 
			developers wanting to try Spring DR.</para>

		<section id="get-started:first-steps:nosql">
			<title>Knowing NoSQL and Key Value stores</title>
			<para>NoSQL stores have taken the storage world by storm. It is a vast domain with a plethora of solutions, terms and patterns (to make things worse even the
			term itself has multiple <ulink url="http://www.google.com/search?q=nosoql+acronym">meanings</ulink>).
			While some of the principles are common, it is crucial that the user is familiar to some degree with the stores supported by SDR.
			The best way to get acquainted with these solutions is to read their documentation and follow their examples - it usually doesn't take more then 5-10 minutes
			to go through them and if you are coming from an RDMBS-only background many times these exercises can be an eye opener.

			<title>Trying Out The Samples</title>
			<para>One can find various samples for key value stores in the dedicated example repo, at 
			<ulink url="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue-examples">http://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue-examples</ulink>. For Spring Data Redis,
			of interest is the <literal>retwisj</literal> sample, a Twitter-clone built on top of Redis which can be run locally or be deployed into the cloud. See its 
			<ulink url="http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-keyvalue/examples/retwisj/current/">documentation</ulink>, the following blog 
			<ulink url="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/04/27/getting-started-redis-spring-cloud-foundry/">entry</ulink> or the
