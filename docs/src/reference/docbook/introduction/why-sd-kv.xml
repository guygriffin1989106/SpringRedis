    <title>Why Spring Data - Key Value?</title>

    <para>The Spring Framework is the leading full-stack Java/JEE
    application framework. It provides a lightweight container and a
    non-invasive programming model enabled by the use of dependency
    injection, AOP, and portable service abstractions.</para>

    storages provide an alternative to classical RDBMS for horizontal scalability
    and speed. In terms of implementation, Key Value stores represent one of the
    largest (and oldest) member in the NoSQL space.</para>

    <para>The Spring Data Key Value (or SDKV) framework makes it easy to 
    write Spring applications that use a Key Value store by eliminating the redundant
    tasks and boiler place code required for interacting with the store through
    Spring's excellent infrastructure support.</para>
