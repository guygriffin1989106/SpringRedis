# Contributing

Here are some ways for you to get involved in the community:

* Get involved with the Spring community on the Spring Community Forums.  Please help out on the [forum](http://forum.spring.io/forum/spring-projects/data/nosql) by responding to questions and joining the debate.
* Create [JIRA](https://jira.springframework.org/browse/DATAREDIS) tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on the ones that you are interested in.  
* Watch for upcoming articles on Spring by [subscribing](https://spring.io/blog) to spring.io.

Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from [forks of this repository](http://help.github.com/forking/). If you want to contribute code this way, read the Spring Framework [contributor guidelines] (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
