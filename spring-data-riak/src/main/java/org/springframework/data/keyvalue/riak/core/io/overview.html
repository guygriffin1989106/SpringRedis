  Utilities for working with resources stored in Riak as standard java.io objects. Opening a <a
    href="RiakInputStream.html">RiakInputStream</a> to a resource will allow code that doesn't
  know anything about Key/Value datastores to access resources stored within them.

  Alternatively, writing data to a <a href="RiakOutputStream.html">RiakOutputStream</a> will
  create a resources in Riak without exposing any of the underlying data access code to the
  calling application.
